                    <p>Goldcrest High imparts quality education keeping in mind the total development of the child.</p>

                    <p>We endeavour to design our educational processes on the basis that the future of this world rests upon the overall competence, sensibility and goodness of its youth. The need of the hour is to raise our children in such a way that they lead a good quality life and become responsible global citizens of the future. </p>

                    <p>We thus have to educate them not only with instruction but also by drawing out their hidden potential with all the attention and care that they deserve. </p>

                    <p>The purpose of providing quality education is manifold. Apart from making them more knowledgeable and good problem solvers, it enables students to live their life fully at all ages, prepares them for challenges ahead and grooms them in noble culture values. Still higher than this aim is that it creates in students a thirst for greater knowledge. </p>

                    <p>Goldcrest High imparts this quality education keeping in mind the total development of the child. Children get a modern education in an atmosphere that preserves the rich Indian culture, values achievement, builds character and enriches these young minds. Most of all the school enshrines the dignity and self-worth of each individual. </p>

                    <p>Since the time of its inception in 2008, I have seen how well the Goldcrest Group of Schools has preserved and honoured the vision of its Founder, Hon. Shri Vilasrao Deshmukh.</p>
                    <p>
                        Goldcrest High, Latur was the first to be established under the aegis of Manjara Charitable Trust whose primary goal was to impart education to children in all walks of life. I applaud the efforts of all those associated with the School in creating an institution that stays true to the vision and ideals of the Trust while simultaneously preparing students to deal with the complex challenges of the outside world.

                    </p>

                    <p>My very best wishes to Goldcrest high, Latur for its continued success.</p>

                    <p>
                        The aim of education is the development of that bent of mind, that attitude of reason, that spirit of democracy which will make global citizens. Goldcrest High seeks to create an education system that would develop within the child the full range of human capacities- intellectual, social, physical and spiritual; an education that would instill a thirst for knowledge and foster a desire for excellence. Such aspirations acquired in childhood will determine the child's future life.
                    </p>

                    <p>Today, it is the concern of all parents that their children grow up to be happy, well-educated and good human beings. To enable this to happen, parents and schools have to explore creative methods of teaching. At Goldcrest High, our endeavour is to harness depths of our ancient heritage and adapt them to the modern world. Creative sports and ancient techniques such as yoga, as a part of a child's learning process, add a dimension to learning that instills in the child confidence and discipline at a deeper level. The path to holistic education is made up of many such small steps. It is the endeavour of the Trust, the Board, and teachers to provide our students with the tools needed for a happy and fulfilling life.</p>

                    <p>
                        The genesis of Goldcrest High, Latur, established in 2010, was a commitment to and love for the cause of education that took into account the needs of today’s children in a constantly changing and shrinking world. We opened its doors in the belief that a school is the heart of a community, and in the knowledge that as our wards streamed through our doors they brought with them their aspirations and hopes as also those of their parents and caregivers.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Teachers, parents and other stakeholders have to continually re-invent themselves if they hope to fulfil these hopes and aspirations. Our young learners are exposed to information in a way never seen before. As such, their educators would need to meet the challenge of providing an education that is at par with world requirements and one that does justice to their abilities.
                    </p>


                    <p>Goldcrest High’s Vision and Mission reflect the Education Goal of the United Nations – one that aims to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.” In pursuit of this, we leverage best-known practices to create an education system that prepares teachers and students for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century and which would also contribute to the national economic and social growth. It will take an entire community and very intentional efforts on the part of parents, teachers and students to contribute towards this growth.</p>

                    <p>Dear Parents,</p>
                    <p>Welcome to the Goldcrest High family!</p>
                    <p>At Goldcrest High, we believe education is more than just filling minds with facts. It is about igniting intelligence, shaping character, and fostering imagination. As Margaret Mead said, "Children must be taught how to think, not what to think," and that's exactly what we strive to do.</p>

                    <p>Every child, from the "weak" to the "gifted," is challenged and nurtured to reach their full potential. We understand that the world is evolving rapidly and our focus is to equip students with the skills and values they need to thrive in this dynamic landscape. </p>
                    <p>While education today often emphasizes technology and globalization, we never lose sight of the importance of moral values and principles. Aristotle eloquently stated, "Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all." At Goldcrest High, we instill these fundamental qualities alongside academic excellence, shaping our students into responsible, sensitive citizens of the future.</p>

                    <p>Our curriculum, from primary to high school, is dynamic and responsive to the changing needs of the world. We emphasize hands-on experiences, collaborative activities, and a spirit of discovery. Beyond academics, our co-curricular activities spark creativity and imagination through art, music, dance, sports, and yoga. We recognize the importance of emotional well-being, and our open and interactive learning environment fosters confidence and resilience.</p>

                    <p>At Goldcrest High, teamwork is our foundation. Together, we create a nurturing space where every child can blossom. We believe our students are the future leaders, and we are dedicated to providing them with the tools and experiences they need to navigate the challenges and embrace the opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
